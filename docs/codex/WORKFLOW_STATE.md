## Latest findings

- Vercel project `fullstack-web-xkxn` / `prj_CaGvMj7pnHTCMTp3iPTsYHCHSdf8` is linked to `Convospanai-outreach/fullstack`.
- Latest Vercel deployment inspected was `READY` from `codex/db-linkage-swarm-orchestration`; recent production deployments from `main` were also `READY`, but readiness is not proven by deploy state.
- Supabase project `Fullstack2026` / `izqcycslipmbgdwgajvu` is `ACTIVE_HEALTHY` on Postgres 17.
- Live Supabase schema fingerprint: `c277e899b339aeb93d8dfaef77426b78`.
- Live DB has 90 public tables and 17 Prisma migration rows.
- Local migration directories exceed live: web 25, API 22.
- Live DB is missing `User.clerk_user_id`, `UserInvitation`, and `invite_requests`, while web Clerk auth depends on them.
- `Lead.embedding` is nullable `text` live; vector extension is installed.
- `20260604140000_edge_runtime_pairing` includes `DELETE FROM "EdgeNode"` and must not run in production as-is.
- Vercel runtime logs showed recent production `200` responses for `/` and `/login`; local DNS maps custom domains to `127.0.0.1`, so direct local smoke checks were not reliable.
- PR #2 is focused but `mergeable=false`; PR #6 is broad, `mergeable=false`, and must be split.
- Implementation REPLAN from commit `d3086c094d145eed0b7f5a5c7eed495bd302fb19` is documented in `docs/codex/IMPLEMENTATION_REPLAN_D3086C0.md`.
- Shared production DB should use a single canonical Prisma schema; `apps/web/prisma/schema.prisma` is the current canonical candidate only after reconciling `Lead.embedding`.
- Unsafe migration `20260604140000_edge_runtime_pairing` is quarantined for production because it deletes orphaned `EdgeNode` rows.
- Additive auth/onboarding repair is planned for `User.clerk_user_id`, `UserInvitation`, and `invite_requests`; no production migration has been generated or applied.
- A read-only verifier now exists at `apps/web/src/scripts/verify-schema-readiness.ts` and can be run with `npm run schema:verify:readonly`; it is not wired as a blocking CI gate.

## Decisions

| Decision | Date | Agent | Evidence | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Vercel READY is insufficient | 2026-06-18 | orchestrator | Deployment metadata and runtime/db blockers | ACCEPTED |
| SELECT 1 is insufficient | 2026-06-18 | runtime-db-agent | Health routes only check `SELECT 1`; schema drift exists | ACCEPTED |
| Do not run production migrations yet | 2026-06-18 | migration-safety-agent | Pending migration contains destructive delete | ACCEPTED |
| Do not merge PR #6 as-is | 2026-06-18 | pr-strategy-agent | PR #6 broad/conflicting diff | ACCEPTED |
| Shared production DB requires one canonical Prisma schema | 2026-06-18 | orchestrator | `docs/audits/prisma-canonical-schema-decision.md` | PROPOSED |
| Quarantine `20260604140000_edge_runtime_pairing` before production deploy | 2026-06-18 | migration-safety-agent | `docs/audits/unsafe-migration-quarantine.md` | ACCEPTED |
| Auth/onboarding repair must be additive and review-gated | 2026-06-18 | auth-tenant-agent | `docs/audits/auth-schema-repair-plan.md` | ACCEPTED |

## Next action queue

1. Approve or revise the shared canonical Prisma strategy in `docs/audits/prisma-canonical-schema-decision.md`.
2. Replace the quarantined `20260604140000_edge_runtime_pairing` production path with reviewed preflight, audit/backup, non-destructive migration, and manual cleanup approval.
3. Generate a draft additive auth/onboarding migration only after the canonical schema decision is approved.
4. Run `npm run schema:verify:readonly` against the intended database using redacted env handling; do not wire it as blocking CI until expected values are approved.
5. Verify Vercel env keys and targets without exposing values.
6. Resolve Clerk/invite schema mismatch before auth smoke.
7. Verify GitHub Actions are green on the target branch.
8. Split PR #6 into docs, env/auth alias, schema, runtime/API, and UI/test PRs.
